This project was born after thinking that I'd really like to have something like a [Launchpad](https://novationmusic.com/en/launch/launchpad-x) to control and mix sound ambiances while DMing a Dungeons and Dragons game.

What I wanted was a way to start, stop, pause, resume multiple individual soundtracks, while being able to adjust their volume, to create an immersive sound ambiance for the table.

I used a [Pimoroni Keypad](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-rgb-keypad-base?variant=32369517166675), as well as a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://learn.pimoroni.com/article/getting-started-with-pico), for a total budget of roughly 30 euro.
